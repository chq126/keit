        <p><em>Hạ Long Bay</em>, in northeast Vietnam, is known for its <strong>emerald waters</strong> and thousands of <strong>towering limestone islands topped by rainforests</strong>. Junk boat tours and sea kayak expeditions take visitors past islands named for their shapes, including Stone Dog and Teapot islets. The region is popular for <em>scuba diving, rock climbing and hiking, particularly in mountainous Cát Bà National Park</em>. </p>

        <p><em>Hội An</em> is a city on Vietnam’s central coast known for its well-preserved Ancient Town, cut through with canals. The former port city’s melting-pot history is reflected in its architecture, a mix of eras and styles from <strong>wooden Chinese shophouses</strong> and <strong>temples</strong> to <strong>colorful French colonial buildings</strong>, <strong>ornate Vietnamese tube houses</strong> and the <strong>iconic Japanese Covered Bridge with its pagoda</strong>.</p>

        <p><em>Bà Nà Hills</em> is a hill station and resort located in the Trường Sơn Mountains west of the city of Da Nang, in central Vietnam. The station, advertised as "the Da Lat (A city of Vietnam) of Danang province" by local tourism authorities, was founded in 1919 by French colonists.

Being located above 1500 metres above sea level, it has a <strong>view of the East Sea and the surrounding mountains</strong>.</p>
